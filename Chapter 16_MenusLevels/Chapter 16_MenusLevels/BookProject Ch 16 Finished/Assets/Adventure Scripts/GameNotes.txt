Name- A descriptive name such as “Open Chest Lid”
Location – state of being of the object- visible, pickable, etc
Visibility Type -  how to handle visibility for this state
Description (verbose)- Example “It is a beautifully constructed chest lid laying open for all to see”
Animation – the animation that will play when the object goes into this state 
Animation Delay- Time delay associated with the animation
Audio- the sound effect associated with the animation
Audio Delay- the delay associated with the sound effect
Loop Animation- the animation that will play after the initial animation
Loop Audio- Sound effect associated with the looping animation


Location:
0-Object is in scene and active
1-Object is in Inventory 
2-Object is Cursor 
3-Object is not pickable (in scene and inactive) 
4-Object is no longer in scene

Visibility Type
0- N/A
1 -Show at start 
2- Hide at start
3 -Show at start, hide at end
4- Hide at end

Cursor States:
0- Not in scene
1- In Inventory
2- Is Cursor

Generic Replies:
	"@" represents the picked object
	"^" represents the cursor that picked it

Drop Type:
0 – Not droppable
1 – Droppable
2 – Is a drop location

case "a": trigger animation only on the auxiliary object
case "s": send a message to a script on this object to the “DoTheJob” function
case "b": change the state on the object only- no animations
case "p": instantiate a prefab-
	   the prefab is put in the Prefabs array at the bottom of the Object Lookup component, its element number is the is s2 number that follows the p, example: p2_Some Object, instanciates the prefab at element 2 on the object that was picked


Setting the new state to -1 in the Lookup information flags an object to remain in its current state, but display an action message

Audio:
Sound effects on objects tagged as "ActionObjects" are played via PlayClipAtPoint  
Sound effects on non-action objects must be tagged as "FX"
Audio Source components on "ActionObjects" are reserved for voice/dialogue
Non-ActionObjects with Audio Sources for voice/dialogue must be tagged as "Voice"
Objects with Audio Source components for ambient sounds must be tagged as "Ambient"
Objects with Audio Source components for music must be tagged as "Music"

Menu Backgrounds:
Menu backgrounds can be 2D or 3D
The menuCameras and menuBackgrounds arrays hold the available assets
For cameras, element 0 is the default player or main camera 
For texture backgrounds, a plain black texture is default, element 0, background 100
If a menu ever uses more than the default main camera, it must have an array containing?
 the assignments for each level by element number
Level 0 = Start menu
Level 1 = MainLevel
Level 3 = FinalLevel
Texture backgrounds will be the texture's element number + 100  
Example: the array for the settings menu might look as follows: (0,2,101),
where in the mainLevel, it uses the camera in element 2 of the menuCameras array and in the FinalLevel, it uses the texture in element 1 of the menuBackgrounds array 

Non-Action Objects with states: 
Objects whose states need to be tracked for load/save must have the GenericStateTracker script
The object must contain a function called "UpdateStateVar" that updates the object's current state into the GenericStateTracker
The object must contain a function named "LoadState" that receives the new state as an argument and processes the object and its dependencies appropriately
The LoadState function may be in any of its scripts
